# Edufolio Builder  
## Overview

A React Native mobile application built for iOS for the 2023-24 FBLA Mobile Application Development Competition. This app allows highschool students to create a portfolio of their highschool experiences. We used React Native primarily because it could support both iOS and Android and is also very versatile. We also used Expo Go to deploy our application during testing and is also how the app runs. The app is not planned for release to the App Store yet. Some of the main challenges we faced were figuring out how to save and load data while also being able to add and delete data. Furthermore, we also had difficulty getting all this data from different screens to collect into an individual screen to display as a portfolio.
